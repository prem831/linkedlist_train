# linkedlist_train
linked list implimented in train terminology

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. 

It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence

I have implimented this data structure concept (linkedlist) with train terminology so that it will be little interesting to learn.

Please check and let me know if any improvemnets needed or new methods you want me to add
